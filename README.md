# üêã Watcher
This project is maintained with ‚ù§Ô∏è by DukeFerdinand.

## Motivation
Tired of not knowing how many whales are lurking beneath the waves of your favorite coin?

Worry no more, friend. We'll provide the charts, and you can bring the harpoons (or cameras).

## How to run
This is a WIP section!

This watcher is a simple TypeScript app. All you need is `pnpm` (run `npm install -g pnpm` or `yarn global add pnpm`).

### To run for dev
- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm dev`

You'll see terminal outputs to let you know it's working.

### To run for production
??? WIP ???
